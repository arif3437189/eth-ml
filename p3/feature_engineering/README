Running extract_features.m will generate the matrix training_data with 890 
rows (each of which refers to one training sample) and 698 columns whose 
meaning is the following:
[sample_id, features(col 2 to 697), sample_label].

Tweaking this script, using as input the data set csv you are going to be
evaluated on, you will be able to generate the exact same matrix also for
the validation and test set.

File List in this folder: 

- extract_features.m:  Matlab script to generate initial features. 

- process_image.m: Computes the features for a single image.

(The above two files are the ones you want to look into for adding new features.)

- DIPUMToolboxV1.1.3:  the matlab toolbox with the book: Rafael C Gonzalez,
Richard Eugene Woods, and Steven L Eddins. Digital image processing using
MATLAB.
Pearson Education India, 2004.

- images/  containing all the raw data for 1272 nuclei

- train_labels.csv    containing labels for the training data, [sample_id, sample_label]

- PHOG/   functions used for PHOG feature extraction.

- sig_1D_signature.m  function used to generate the 1D signature
