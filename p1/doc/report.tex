\maketitle

\section*{Experimental Protocol}

To obtain the model from raw data, I did the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item asd
\end{itemize}


Suppose that someone wants to reproduce your results. Briefly describe the steps used to obtain the
predictions starting from the raw data set downloaded from the project website. Use the following
sections to explain your methodology. Feel free to add graphs or screenshots if you think it's
necessary. The report should contain a maximum of 2 pages.

\section{Tools}
I used:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Python 2.7
	\item scikit-learn for training a LASSO classifier
	\item NumPy for everything else
\end{itemize}

All code used for this project is wrapped into a single class in \verb{Regressor.py}.

\section{Algorithm}
Describe the algorithm you used for regression (e.g. ordinary least squares, ridge regression, $\ldots$)

\section{Features}
Did you construct any new features? What feature transforms did you use?

\section{Parameters}
How did you find the parameters of your model? (What parameters have you searched over, cross validation procedure, $\ldots$)

\section{Lessons Learned} What other algorithms, tools or methods did you try out that didn't work well?
Why do you think they performed worse than what you used for your final submission?
